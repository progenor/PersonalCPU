2. REPORT DETAILS

REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 mem/ram_2k_generate.akv7.kcpsm6_rom has an input control pin mem/ram_2k_generate.akv7.kcpsm6_rom/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: mem/Q[6]) which is driven by a register (processor/PFC_inst/programflowcontrol.programcounter_reg[6]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
